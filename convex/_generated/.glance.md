The `_generated` directory serves as the type-safe integration layer between the Convex backend framework and the "bibliomnomnom" application logic. It contains automatically generated TypeScript definitions and JavaScript wrappers that synchronize the project's database schema and API functions with the Convex runtime.

### Architecture and Purpose
The directory implements a "Generated Code" pattern designed to provide end-to-end type safety. It acts as a bridge that transforms static definitions (like `schema.js`) and file-based function exports into structured, discoverable objects. This architecture ensures that database interactions, inter-function calls, and client-side requests are validated against the current state of the backend.

### Key File Roles
*   **`dataModel.d.ts`**: This is the foundational type definition file. It imports the user-defined `schema.js` and uses Convex primitives to generate the `DataModel` type. It exports helper types like `Doc` (representing a document in a specific table) and `Id` (representing table-specific document identifiers), ensuring that database queries return correctly shaped data.
*   **`server.js` and `server.d.ts`**: these files export specialized versions of Convex function builders—`query`, `mutation`, `action`, and their `internal` counterparts. By parameterizing these builders with the local `DataModel`, the generated `QueryCtx`, `MutationCtx`, and `ActionCtx` provide a `db` object that is aware of the application's specific tables and indexes.
*   **`api.js` and `api.d.ts`**: These files function as a central registry for all backend logic. They scan the project directory (including subdirectories like `actions/`) and map modules such as `bookSearch`, `auth`, `books`, and `webhookEvents` into a structured `api` object. This allows developers to reference functions using dot notation (e.g., `api.books.list`) with full autocompletion and signature validation.

### Important Dependencies and Gotchas
*   **Automatic Generation**: All files in this directory are managed by the Convex CLI. Manual modifications are volatile and will be overwritten whenever `npx convex dev` or `npx convex codegen` is executed.
*   **Synchronization**: The types in this directory are strictly coupled with the local `schema.js` and the file structure of the parent `convex/` folder. Adding a new `.js` or `.ts` file to the parent directory triggers a regeneration of `api.d.ts`.
*   **Peer Dependencies**: The code relies on the `convex` npm package, specifically referencing `convex/server` for generic builders and `convex/values` for runtime type handling.
*   **Internal vs. Public**: The architecture enforces a distinction between `public` API functions (accessible by clients) and `internal` functions (accessible only by other Convex functions), preventing accidental exposure of sensitive logic.
