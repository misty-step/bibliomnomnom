The `/Users/phaedrus/Development/bibliomnomnom/__tests__/fixtures` directory serves as a dedicated repository for static test data used to validate the parsing, extraction, and transformation logic of the parent application. It functions as a decoupled data layer within the testing suite, providing consistent and predictable inputs for unit and integration tests focused on document processing.

### Architecture and Key File Roles

The directory is structured as a flat collection of sample documents that mirror the expected input formats the application is designed to ingest.

- **`reading-sample.md`**: This file acts as a primary test fixture for the application's Markdown parser. It contains a structured reading log featuring hierarchical headers (`##`, `###`), list items, and specific metadata patterns. It is utilized to verify the system's ability to differentiate between "Currently Reading" and "Books by Year" sections, as well as its capacity to extract titles, authors, and completion dates from formatted strings (e.g., `_ (Nov 2) _`).

### Key Dependencies and Gotchas

- **Pattern Matching Sensitivity**: The application’s parser likely relies on specific Markdown syntax and regex patterns demonstrated in these fixtures. Modifications to the spacing, header levels, or date formatting within `reading-sample.md` will directly impact test outcomes, as the logic is tightly coupled to the structure of the Markdown elements.
- **Temporal Logic**: The fixture includes specific years (2025, 2021) and relative dates, which may be significant if the application performs chronological sorting or date-based filtering.
- **Encoding**: As the fixtures contain specialized punctuation (e.g., parentheses and underscores used as delimiters), the processing pipeline is dependent on consistent character encoding to prevent failures during tokenization or string splitting.
