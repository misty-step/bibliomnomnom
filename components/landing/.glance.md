The `components/landing` directory contains the UI components responsible for the visual identity and user conversion funnel of the application's landing page. The architecture relies on client-side interactivity to manage animations, accessibility preferences, and event tracking.

### Key Components

- **`ArchetypeCarousel.tsx`**: Implements an infinite-scrolling horizontal ticker that showcases reader personas.
  - **Logic**: It utilizes a shuffled array of archetypes, duplicated to create a seamless loop. The component includes a `useReducedMotion` hook from `framer-motion` to provide a static grid fallback for users with motion sensitivities.
  - **Interactivity**: It manages local state to pause animations on hover or focus, ensuring accessibility for keyboard and mouse users.
  - **Design Note**: It intentionally bypasses standard design tokens for card widths (`w-[260px]`, `w-[320px]`) to maintain the precision required for the CSS-based ticker animation.

- **`CTAButton.tsx`**: A specialized navigation component designed to drive user conversion.
  - **Logic**: It wraps the Next.js `Link` component and integrates with PostHog for product analytics. Every click triggers a `landing_cta_click` event, capturing the specific `location` (hero, features, or closing) to facilitate conversion path analysis.
  - **Theming**: Supports `primary` and `ghost` variants using utility-first styling.

### Dependencies and Technical Constraints

- **PostHog**: The `CTAButton` depends on a PostHog provider being initialized higher in the component tree; otherwise, analytics captures will be bypassed.
- **Framer Motion**: Used specifically for the `useReducedMotion` hook to ensure WCAG compliance regarding non-essential movement.
- **Tailwind CSS & Utility Classes**: Styling is driven by a custom `cn` utility for class merging. The ticker animation relies on a custom CSS animation defined in the global configuration (`animate-archetype-ticker`).
- **Client-Side Rendering**: Both components are marked with the `"use client"` directive due to their reliance on browser APIs (state, hooks, and event listeners).
