The `/components/layout` directory serves as the structural framework for the application, providing reusable UI components that define the global layout, spacing constraints, and entry animations. The architecture adopts a modular, utility-driven approach using React and Tailwind CSS, complemented by a co-located testing suite to ensure structural integrity across different application states.

Key file roles include:

- **`FadeInContent.tsx`**: A client-side wrapper component that utilizes `framer-motion` to implement a standardized entry animation (opacity and vertical translation) for page content.
- **`Footer.tsx`**: A global navigational component that renders project attribution, application versioning derived from environment variables, and links to internal and external resources.
- **`PageContainer.tsx`**: A layout utility that enforces responsive horizontal padding across various breakpoints, ensuring consistent content alignment for standard pages.
- **`__tests__/`**: A dedicated validation suite leveraging React Testing Library and Jest to verify the rendering and logic of layout components, including navigation triggers and viewport-specific behavior.

Primary dependencies include **Framer Motion** for animation orchestration, **Next.js** for routing and environment variable injection, and **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design.

Significant technical gotchas include:

- **Environment Variables**: The `Footer` component relies on `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION` to display versioning information; missing variables will default to `0.0.0`.
- **Client Boundary**: `FadeInContent` is designated as a Client Component ("use client"), meaning it must be positioned correctly in the component tree to manage hydration boundaries effectively.
- **Layout Constraints**: `PageContainer` is specifically designed for non-full-bleed layouts; pages requiring full-bleed background sections must bypass this wrapper to handle their own internal padding.
- **Test Environment**: Components in this directory often consume global contexts (Auth, Theme) and Next.js routing hooks, requiring robust mocking and provider wrapping within the `__tests__` suite to prevent runtime errors during automated validation.
