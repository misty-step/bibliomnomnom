The `/components/onboarding` directory serves as the initial interaction layer for new users within the application, specifically targeting the transition from an empty state to an active library. The architecture follows a modular, presentational pattern where onboarding-specific views are isolated to streamline the first-run user experience.

### Key File Roles

- **`WelcomeCard.tsx`**: This is a client-side presentational component designed for the library's empty state. It functions as a navigational hub, prioritizing data ingestion via a primary "Import from Goodreads" action while providing a secondary path for manual entry. It also manages the display of trial-related metadata, such as remaining access days.

### Architecture and Logic

The directory is structured to handle the "cold start" problem of a personal library manager. The components are built using React's client-side rendering (`"use client"`) to handle immediate user interactions and callback executions (`onImport`, `onAddBook`). The UI logic emphasizes a clear hierarchy of actions, utilizing a "primary-action" pattern to reduce cognitive load during the initial setup phase.

### Dependencies and Technical Constraints

- **UI Framework**: The components rely on a local UI library (specifically `@/components/ui/button`) and the `lucide-react` icon set for visual affordances.
- **Styling**: Styling is managed via Tailwind CSS, utilizing a custom design system with specific tokens for typography (`font-display`) and color scales (`text-text-ink`, `text-text-inkMuted`, `text-text-inkSubtle`).
- **Utility Integration**: Class merging is handled by a centralized utility (`@/lib/utils`), allowing for external style overrides via a `className` prop.
- **Contextual Dependencies**: The onboarding components expect trial state and action handlers to be injected from a parent controller or page, keeping the components decoupled from the underlying data-fetching or routing logic.
