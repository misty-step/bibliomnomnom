The `/components/shared` directory serves as a central repository for reusable, stateless, and state-aware UI components designed to handle universal application states and global utilities. The architecture emphasizes "Client Component" patterns, with all files utilizing the `"use client"` directive to manage interactivity, lifecycle events, and browser-specific APIs.

### Architecture and Key File Roles

- **State Feedback Components**: A significant portion of the directory is dedicated to handling the lifecycle of data-driven views.
  - **`EmptyState.tsx`**: Provides a specialized UI for null data sets, prioritizing editorial typography with a serif-based display font and flexible action slots.
  - **`LoadingSkeleton.tsx`**: Implements a CSS-based pulse animation to create placeholder wireframes for asynchronous content loading.
  - **`ErrorState.tsx`**: A functional component for rendering inline error messages with optional retry callbacks.
- **Error Handling**:
  - **`ErrorBoundary.tsx`**: A React Class Component that acts as a safety wrapper for component sub-trees. It implements `getDerivedStateFromError` and `componentDidCatch` to prevent application-wide crashes, offering a default or custom fallback UI.
- **Global Utilities**:
  - **`ThemeToggle.tsx`**: Manages the application's visual mode (light/dark). It interacts with the `next-themes` provider and includes logic to synchronize the system preference with the manual override.

### Dependencies and Technical Gotchas

- **Theme Hydration**: `ThemeToggle.tsx` implements a `mounted` state check. This is a critical pattern to prevent hydration mismatches, as the component must wait for the client-side theme to resolve before rendering icons (`Sun`, `Moon`) that depend on local storage or system preferences.
- **Styling and Tokens**: The components rely heavily on a custom Tailwind CSS configuration. They utilize specific design tokens such as `text-ink`, `surface-dawn`, `line-ghost`, and `ease-fast`. The `cn` utility from `@/lib/utils` is required for dynamic class merging.
- **External Libraries**:
  - **`lucide-react`**: Provides the iconography for the theme switcher.
  - **`next-themes`**: Essential for the `useTheme` hook functionality.
- **Accessibility**: `ThemeToggle` includes explicit ARIA attributes (`role="switch"`, `aria-live`, `aria-checked`) and manual keyboard event handling for `Enter` and `Space` keys to ensure screen reader compatibility.
