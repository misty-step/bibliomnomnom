The `/content` directory serves as the primary data and narrative layer for the Bibliomnomnom project. It functions as a centralized repository for all project-related documentation, version-specific metadata, and static assets, decoupling the informational "source of truth" from the core application logic.

### Architecture

The directory employs a content-driven, hierarchical architecture consistent with documentation-as-code and static site generation (SSG) patterns. It is organized into logical subdirectories, such as `/releases`, which act as discrete content collections. This structure allows the application to ingest Markdown or YAML files and programmatically transform them into dynamic UI elements, API endpoints, or structured feeds. The mapping of the filesystem directly influences the application's routing and taxonomy.

### Key File Roles

- **Content Collections (Subdirectories):** Subdirectories like `/releases` function as containers for specific data types. They group related entities—such as version milestones or changelogs—enabling bulk processing and consistent schema application across a set of files.
- **Data Nodes (Markdown/YAML):** Individual files within these subdirectories serve as data objects. They utilize a dual-structure format: structured front-matter (metadata) for machine-readability (e.g., version tags, dates, status) and narrative body content for human consumption.
- **Collection Metadata (Index Files):** Files such as `_index.md` define the configuration for a collection. They govern the sorting behavior, display titles, and aggregation logic for the nodes contained within that specific branch of the directory tree.

### Dependencies and Gotchas

- **Front-Matter Schema Consistency:** The directory relies on a strict metadata parser. Any inconsistency in field naming (e.g., using `date` in one file and `timestamp` in another) will result in data omission or build failures during the rendering phase.
- **Chronological and Semantic Sorting:** For collections like `/releases`, the system is highly dependent on standardized naming conventions (SemVer) or ISO 8601 date strings. Failure to adhere to these formats will cause the project timeline to display out of sequence.
- **Build-Time Visibility Flags:** Content visibility is frequently managed via "draft" or "hidden" booleans within the file metadata. If these flags are not explicitly audited, internal or incomplete documentation may be inadvertently exposed in production environments.
- **Path-to-Route Mapping:** Because the directory structure defines the URL architecture, moving or renaming files without implementing redirects will result in broken links and the loss of indexed content.
