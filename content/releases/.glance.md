The `/content/releases` directory serves as the centralized repository for version-specific metadata and documentation within the Bibliomnomnom project. Its primary purpose is to provide a structured data layer for tracking software or publication milestones, changelogs, and distribution details, decoupling historical records from the core application logic.

### Architecture

The directory follows a content-driven architecture typical of static site generators (SSGs) or documentation-as-code frameworks. It utilizes a flat or hierarchical file structure where each entity represents a discrete release node. This design allows for the automated ingestion of release data into the project's UI or API, treating Markdown or data-serialized files as the authoritative source of truth for the project's timeline.

### Key File Roles

- **Release Entries:** Individual files (typically `.md` or `.yaml`) function as data objects for specific versions. These files house structured front-matter (e.g., version tags, publication dates, and status) and narrative content (e.g., feature highlights and bug fix lists).
- **Collection Metadata:** If present, index files (such as `_index.md`) define the taxonomy and sorting behavior for the releases section, governing how individual release nodes are aggregated and rendered in a list or feed format.

### Dependencies and Gotchas

- **Parser Dependency:** The directory relies on a specific front-matter parser or content engine to interpret metadata. Inconsistencies in field naming (e.g., `version` vs. `tag`) will result in missing data during the build or render phase.
- **Chronological Sorting:** A significant gotcha involves the reliance on either file naming conventions or internal timestamp metadata for ordering. If semantic versioning (SemVer) or ISO 8601 dates are not strictly followed, the release history may display out of sequence.
- **Build Constraints:** Content visibility is often tied to a "draft" flag within the files; if this boolean is not explicitly managed, intended releases may be excluded from the production environment.
