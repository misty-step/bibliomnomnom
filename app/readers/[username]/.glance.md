This directory implements the dynamic route for public-facing reader profiles within the `bibliomnomnom` application. Utilizing the Next.js App Router's dynamic segment pattern, it resolves the `[username]` parameter to display specific user data, reading statistics, and curated "taste taglines."

### Architecture and Key File Roles

The directory follows a server-side data fetching pattern for metadata while delegating UI rendering to specialized components.

- **`page.tsx`**: Acts as the entry point for the `/readers/[username]` route. It performs two primary functions:
  - **Metadata Generation**: Exports an async `generateMetadata` function that utilizes the `ConvexHttpClient` to fetch profile data on the server. This facilitates dynamic SEO by populating OpenGraph and Twitter tags with user-specific info, such as display names, book counts, and custom reading insights.
  - **Route Rendering**: Serves as a Server Component that extracts the `username` from the dynamic route parameters and passes it to the `PublicProfile` component for client-side or hydration-based rendering.

### Key Dependencies

- **Convex**: The backend-as-a-service provider used for data persistence. The `ConvexHttpClient` is specifically employed here to allow server-side queries outside of the standard React hook lifecycle.
- **Next.js Metadata API**: Used to construct complex social sharing objects, including dynamic image generation via an internal `/api/og/profile` endpoint.

### Technical Gotchas

- **Environment Variables**: The implementation strictly requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` for data fetching and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` for constructing absolute URLs required by OpenGraph specifications.
- **Async Params**: In alignment with newer Next.js versions, the `params` object is treated as a Promise and must be awaited before accessing the `username` property.
- **Data Availability**: The `generateMetadata` function includes logic to handle non-existent profiles, providing a fallback "Profile Not Found" state to prevent metadata generation failures for invalid routes.
