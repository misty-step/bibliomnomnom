This directory implements the dynamic routing logic for public-facing reader profiles within the `bibliomnomnom` application. Utilizing the Next.js App Router's dynamic segment pattern, it resolves the `[username]` parameter to display specific user data, reading statistics, and curated "taste taglines."

### Architecture and Key File Roles

The directory follows a server-side data fetching pattern for metadata while delegating UI rendering to specialized components.

- **`page.tsx`**: Serves as the primary entry point for the `/readers/[username]` route. It functions as a Server Component that performs two critical tasks:
  - **Metadata Generation**: It exports an async `generateMetadata` function that leverages the `ConvexHttpClient` to fetch profile data directly from the backend during the request lifecycle. This enables dynamic SEO by populating OpenGraph and Twitter tags with user-specific information, such as display names and reading insights.
  - **Route Rendering**: It extracts the `username` from the dynamic route parameters and passes it to the `PublicProfile` component, facilitating the transition from server-side parameter resolution to the main profile view.

### Key Dependencies

- **Convex**: The backend-as-a-service provider used for data persistence. The implementation specifically utilizes the `ConvexHttpClient` to allow for server-side queries that exist outside of the standard React hook lifecycle.
- **Next.js Metadata API**: Utilized to construct complex social sharing objects, including dynamic image generation via an internal `/api/og/profile` endpoint for rich link previews.

### Technical Gotchas

- **Async Params**: In accordance with recent Next.js updates, the `params` object is treated as a Promise and must be awaited before the `username` property can be accessed.
- **Environment Variables**: The logic strictly requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` for backend communication and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to construct the absolute URLs required by OpenGraph specifications.
- **Data Availability**: The `generateMetadata` function includes specific logic to handle non-existent profiles, providing a fallback "Profile Not Found" state to prevent metadata generation failures or 500 errors when navigating to invalid routes.
