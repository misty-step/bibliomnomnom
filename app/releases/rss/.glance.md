The `/app/releases/rss` directory implements a dynamic RSS 2.0 feed for the application's release notes. It functions as a Next.js Route Handler, providing a machine-readable syndication format for product updates.

### Architecture and Purpose

The directory serves a single purpose: generating an XML-based RSS feed at the `/releases/rss` endpoint. It utilizes the Next.js App Router's `GET` handler to fetch release data, transform it into valid XML, and serve it with appropriate HTTP headers for client-side consumption and caching.

### Key File Roles

- **`route.ts`**: This is the primary execution point. It orchestrates the data retrieval from the internal library, performs the transformation from JavaScript objects to XML strings, and handles character escaping. It specifically:
  - Retrieves release data via the `getReleases` utility.
  - Limits the feed to the 20 most recent items to maintain performance and feed size.
  - Constructs the RSS 2.0 schema, including `<channel>` metadata and individual `<item>` entries.
  - Implements manual XML entity escaping for titles and links, while wrapping product notes in `CDATA` sections to preserve HTML or special characters.
  - Returns a `NextResponse` with the `application/xml` content type and a one-hour public cache control header.

### Dependencies and Technical Details

- **Internal Library (`../lib`)**: The route depends on `getReleases` for data fetching and `escapeCdata` for sanitizing release descriptions.
- **Environment Variables**: The feed relies on `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to generate absolute URLs for the feed link, atom self-link, and individual release items. If this variable is missing, it defaults to `https://bibliomnomnom.com`.
- **Standard Compliance**: The implementation uses `toUTCString()` to ensure dates conform to the RFC 822/2822 format required by the RSS specification.
- **Gotchas**:
  - The feed is generated via manual string concatenation rather than an external XML builder library, requiring strict adherence to the local `escapeXml` utility to prevent malformed XML.
  - The `guid` for each item is generated using a non-permalink string format (`bibliomnomnom-v{version}`), with `isPermaLink="false"`.
  - The feed includes an `atom:link` for self-reference, which requires the `xmlns:atom` namespace defined in the root `<rss>` tag.
