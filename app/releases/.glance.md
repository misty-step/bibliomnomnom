This directory implements the product release notes section of the application, providing both a visual web interface and a machine-readable RSS 2.0 feed. The architecture follows a data-driven approach where release content is stored as static assets on the filesystem and consumed via Next.js Server Components and Route Handlers.

### Architecture and Purpose

The directory serves as the hub for communicating product updates. It utilizes a hybrid rendering model:

- **Data Layer**: Release data is sourced from a structured `content/releases` directory containing a global `manifest.json` and version-specific `changelog.json` and `notes.md` files.
- **Web Interface**: A Server Component fetches data at request time (with a one-hour revalidation cache) and passes it to a Client Component for interactive grouping and Markdown rendering.
- **Syndication**: A dedicated sub-route provides an automated RSS feed, ensuring feature parity between the UI and external feed readers.

### Key File Roles

- **`page.tsx`**: The main entry point for the `/releases` route. This Server Component manages SEO metadata, defines the ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) interval via `revalidate`, and fetches the initial dataset. It provides the high-level layout and handles empty states.
- **`ReleasesList.tsx`**: A Client Component responsible for the presentation logic. It groups releases by minor version (e.g., v1.1.x) and implements an accordion-style interface. It handles the transformation of raw Markdown into sanitized HTML.
- **`lib.ts`**: The shared data access layer. It contains utilities for reading the filesystem, parsing version strings, and fetching specific release manifests. It also provides the `escapeCdata` utility used by the RSS route to ensure XML validity.
- **`rss/route.ts`**: A Next.js Route Handler that generates an RSS 2.0 XML feed. It transforms the same release data used by the UI into a valid syndication format, implementing manual XML escaping and proper RFC 822 date formatting.

### Dependencies and Technical Details

- **Markdown Processing**: The directory relies on `marked` for parsing release notes and `dompurify` for sanitizing the resulting HTML. This is critical as the UI uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to render LLM-synthesized or manually written notes.
- **File System Access**: The implementation uses Node.js `fs` and `path` modules to read from the `content/releases` directory at the project root. This assumes the content is generated or placed there during the build process.
- **Environment Variables**: The system relies on `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to construct absolute URLs for both the RSS feed metadata and individual release links.
- **Gotchas**:
  - **Sanitization**: Because `dompurify` is used in a Client Component, it must be handled carefully regarding server-side rendering (SSR) compatibility or executed within `useMemo`/`useEffect`.
  - **Version Formatting**: The grouping logic in `ReleasesList.tsx` assumes a standard `vMajor.Minor.Patch` string format; deviations in version naming may break the grouping and sorting logic.
  - **Manual XML Construction**: The RSS feed is built using string concatenation rather than a dedicated builder library, making the `escapeCdata` and `escapeXml` utilities in `lib.ts` and `route.ts` essential for preventing malformed XML.
