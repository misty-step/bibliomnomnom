The `/app/(dashboard)/import` directory serves as the dedicated route for the application's data ingestion workflow. It functions as a client-side entry point within the Next.js App Router architecture, specifically nested under the `(dashboard)` route group to inherit shared layout characteristics while maintaining a focused interface for importing bibliographic records.

### Architecture and Key Files

The directory follows a modular pattern where the route handler acts as a thin wrapper for complex business logic encapsulated in sub-components.

- **`page.tsx`**: This is the primary entry point for the `/import` route. It is a Client Component that establishes the page layout using a `PageContainer` and provides navigational context via a "Back to Library" link. Its primary structural role is to instantiate the `ImportFlow` component, which orchestrates the multi-step import process.

### Key Dependencies

- **`ImportFlow`**: The core functional component (imported from `@/components/import/ImportFlow`) that likely manages the state machine for file uploads, data parsing, and validation.
- **Lucide React**: Utilized for iconography (`ArrowLeft`) to maintain visual consistency with the rest of the dashboard.
- **Next.js Navigation**: Uses the `Link` component for client-side transitions back to the `/library` route.

### Technical Gotchas

- **Client-Side Execution**: The entire route is marked with the `"use client"` directive. This indicates that the import process, including file handling or local state management, occurs entirely on the client side before any data is persisted to the server.
- **Layout Constraints**: The page utilizes a `max-w-6xl` container, implying that the `ImportFlow` component is designed for a wide-screen, multi-column, or stepper-based UI.
- **Route Grouping**: Being located within `(dashboard)`, this page likely relies on authentication middleware or layout providers defined at a higher level in the directory tree.
