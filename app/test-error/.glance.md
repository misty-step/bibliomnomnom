This directory functions as a diagnostic utility for validating the integration and configuration of Sentry error tracking within the application. It provides a controlled environment to trigger and verify various error-reporting scenarios, ensuring that both automated and manual telemetry are functioning as expected.

### Architecture and Key File Roles

The directory follows the Next.js App Router pattern, bifurcating logic between a server-side entry point and a client-side interactive interface:

- **`page.tsx`**: Serves as the route's primary entry point. It implements a security guard that checks `process.env.NODE_ENV`; if the environment is set to `production`, the component invokes `notFound()`, ensuring the test suite is inaccessible in live environments. In development or preview stages, it renders the client-side component.
- **`TestErrorClient.tsx`**: A Client Component that provides the UI and logic for triggering Sentry events. It utilizes the application's internal Sentry wrapper (`@/lib/sentry`) to execute three specific actions:
  - **Unhandled Exceptions**: Throws a standard JavaScript `Error` to test Sentry's global error handler.
  - **Handled Exceptions**: Uses `captureError` within a `try/catch` block to verify manual exception tracking with custom metadata (tags).
  - **Message Logging**: Uses `captureMessage` to send non-exception informational telemetry.

### Dependencies and Gotchas

- **Sentry Library Dependency**: The functionality is strictly dependent on the local `@/lib/sentry` abstraction. If the underlying Sentry SDK is not initialized or the DSN is missing in the environment variables, these triggers will fail silently or log errors to the console.
- **Environment Restriction**: Because the route is explicitly blocked in production via `process.env.NODE_ENV`, it cannot be used to verify Sentry connectivity in a production build unless the check is manually bypassed for debugging.
- **PII Scrubbing Verification**: The component includes hardcoded email addresses in its test strings. This is a deliberate design choice to verify that the Sentry configuration's data scrubbing rules or `beforeSend` hooks are correctly redacting Personal Identifiable Information (PII) before transmission.
