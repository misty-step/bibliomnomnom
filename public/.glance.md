The `/public` directory serves as the static asset repository for the "bibliomnomnom" application, a digital garden platform. It functions as the root-level storage for files that must be served directly to the client without undergoing a build-step transformation or bundling process.

### Architecture and Purpose

The directory is structured to support Progressive Web App (PWA) functionality and browser-level metadata. By placing assets here, the application ensures they are accessible at the base URL path (e.g., `/manifest.webmanifest`). This is critical for SEO, social sharing, and mobile device integration, where fixed-path resource discovery is required by browsers and operating systems.

### Key File Roles

- **`manifest.webmanifest`**: This JSON configuration file defines the application's identity and behavior when installed on a user's device. It specifies the "standalone" display mode, sets the `start_url` to the root, and establishes the visual identity through `theme_color` and `background_color` (defined as `#FDFBF7`). It acts as the primary descriptor for PWA installation.
- **Asset References**: The manifest explicitly maps the application to specific branding assets, specifically `android-chrome-192x192.png` and `android-chrome-512x512.png`, which are expected to reside within this same directory level to satisfy icon requirements for various device resolutions.

### Important Dependencies and Gotchas

- **Asset Pathing**: The application relies on absolute pathing for static assets. Any icons referenced in the `manifest.webmanifest` must exist physically within the `/public` directory to prevent 404 errors during PWA validation or installation.
- **Caching Strategy**: Assets in this directory are typically served with standard cache headers. Changes to the `manifest.webmanifest` or associated icons may require cache-busting strategies or service worker updates to propagate to returning users.
- **Color Consistency**: The `theme_color` and `background_color` defined in the manifest should align with the application's global CSS variables to ensure a seamless visual transition during the initial loading phase on mobile platforms.
