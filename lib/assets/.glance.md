The `/lib/assets` directory in the `bibliomnomnom` project functions as a centralized repository for shared static resources that are decoupled from the primary application logic. This directory is architecturally intended to house reusable stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images that may be shared across multiple engines or intended for eventual packaging into a library or Ruby gem.

### Purpose and Architecture

The directory follows the conventional Rails Asset Pipeline (Sprockets) structure, segregating resources by type into subdirectories such as `stylesheets`, `javascripts`, and `images`. By placing assets in `lib/` rather than `app/`, the architecture signals that these components are generic utilities or vendor-like extensions specific to the `bibliomnomnom` domain but not tied to specific views or controllers within the main application.

### Key File Roles

- **`stylesheets/`**: Contains CSS or SCSS files defining shared design tokens, mixins, or component styles used across different parts of the ecosystem.
- **`javascripts/`**: Houses reusable scripts, such as internal libraries or vanilla JavaScript modules, that provide functionality independent of the main application bundle.
- **`images/`**: Stores static brand assets, icons, or global graphics used across various modules.

### Dependencies and Technical Considerations

- **Asset Pipeline Integration**: This directory is part of the standard Sprockets search path. However, assets located here are not automatically precompiled unless they are explicitly required in the main application manifests (e.g., `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`) or added to the `config.assets.precompile` array in the application configuration.
- **Load Path Priority**: In the Rails lookup order, `lib/assets` typically sits between `app/assets` (highest priority) and `vendor/assets` (lowest priority). Naming collisions with files in `app/assets` will result in the `lib` versions being shadowed.
- **Engine Exposure**: If `bibliomnomnom` utilizes Rails Engines, assets in this directory must be properly exposed through an `Engine` class inheriting from `Rails::Engine` to ensure they are discoverable by the consuming application's asset manifest.
- **Preprocessing**: Files utilizing extensions like `.scss`, `.sass`, or `.erb` depend on the presence of the corresponding gems (e.g., `sassc-rails`) to be correctly transpiled during the asset compilation phase.
