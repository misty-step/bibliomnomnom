The `lib/browser` directory functions as a specialized utility layer for managing direct interactions with the Browser Object Model (BOM). Its primary purpose is to abstract standard Web API operations into a set of reusable, type-safe functions, centralizing side-effect-heavy browser logic.

### Architecture

The directory employs a modular functional architecture where each file exports specific utilities dedicated to browser-side execution. It acts as a bridge between the application logic and the browser environment, providing a consistent interface for operations that bypass the internal state of a framework (such as a router) to interact directly with the window and document objects.

### Key File Roles

- **`redirect-to.ts`**: This module handles imperative client-side navigation. It encapsulates the `window.location.href` assignment logic, allowing the application to trigger hard redirects to external URLs or internal paths that require a full page refresh.

### Dependencies and Gotchas

- **Environment Constraints**: The utilities within this directory are strictly client-side. They depend on the global `window` object and standard DOM APIs.
- **SSR Compatibility**: Attempting to execute functions from this directory in a Server-Side Rendering (SSR) context—such as during a Node.js build process or initial server render—will result in a `ReferenceError` because the `window` object is not defined. Any imports or invocations must be guarded by environment checks or confined to client-only lifecycle hooks and event handlers.
- **Navigation Side Effects**: The `redirectTo` function triggers a browser-level navigation event, which terminates the current JavaScript execution context and clears the existing application state.
