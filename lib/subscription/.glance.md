This directory serves as a utility module for managing and categorizing subscription tiers within the application's billing logic. Its primary purpose is to abstract Stripe-specific price identifiers into human-readable plan names used throughout the user interface and business logic.

### Architecture and Logic

The module follows a functional utility pattern, decoupling raw infrastructure data (Stripe Price IDs) from domain-level concepts (Plan Names). The architecture relies on a lookup strategy where a configuration object containing environment-specific Stripe IDs is compared against a provided ID to determine the active subscription tier.

### Key File Roles

- **`plan-name.ts`**: Defines the core domain types and transformation logic. It exports the `PlanName` union type ("Monthly" | "Annual" | "Standard") and the `StripePriceIds` interface. The central function, `getPlanNameFromPriceId`, implements the conditional logic to resolve these types based on a provided mapping object.
- **`plan-name.test.ts`**: Provides a comprehensive test suite using the Vitest framework. It validates the mapping logic against various scenarios, including valid matches, undefined inputs, and mismatches between the provided ID and the configuration object.

### Dependencies and Gotchas

- **Dependencies**: The module uses `vitest` for unit testing. The implementation itself is written in TypeScript and has no external runtime dependencies, making it a pure utility.
- **Default Fallback**: The logic defaults to the "Standard" plan name for any unrecognized, null, or undefined price ID. This ensures the application does not crash on missing data but requires that any new pricing tiers added to the Stripe dashboard be manually synchronized with the `PlanName` type and the lookup logic.
- **Configuration Dependency**: The `getPlanNameFromPriceId` function requires a `StripePriceIds` object to be passed in, meaning the caller is responsible for sourcing these IDs (typically from environment variables or a configuration file) before performing the lookup.
