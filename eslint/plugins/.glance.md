This directory contains custom ESLint plugins designed to enforce project-specific architectural constraints and styling standards within the `bibliomnomnom` repository. The architecture follows the standard ESLint plugin pattern, exporting a rules object that utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) traversal to identify and report code quality issues.

### Key File Roles

**design-tokens.js**
This file implements the `no-raw-design-values` rule, which serves as a static analysis gatekeeper for the project’s design system. Its primary role is to prevent the introduction of "magic numbers" and hard-coded styling values directly into the codebase.

- **Detection Logic**: It utilizes regular expressions to identify raw hexadecimal colors, `rgb`/`rgba` functions, and pixel (`px`) measurements within `Literal` and `TemplateElement` AST nodes.
- **Exclusion Logic**: The plugin includes a sophisticated skipping mechanism. It automatically ignores files within `node_modules`, `.next/` directories, and files related to the design token definitions themselves (e.g., `tokens.generated`). It also exempts specific JSX attributes like `sizes` and `media` where raw values are often syntactically required.
- **Configuration**: The rule is highly configurable, allowing developers to pass custom `allow` patterns (as strings or RegEx) and a custom `messageSuffix` via ESLint's `options` schema.

### Dependencies and Technical Constraints

- **ESLint Rule API**: The implementation relies on the standard ESLint `rule.create` context, specifically utilizing `context.report` for issue notification and `context.getFilename()` for path-based filtering.
- **AST Node Targeting**: The plugin specifically targets `Literal` and `TemplateElement` nodes. This ensures it catches both standard string assignments and values within template literals.
- **RegEx Sensitivity**: The detection relies on specific regex patterns (`HEX_REGEX`, `RGB_REGEX`, `PX_REGEX`). A notable technical detail is the use of a negative lookahead in the hex regex to ensure precise matching.
- **Runtime Errors**: The plugin includes a safety wrapper for custom exclusion patterns; providing an invalid regular expression string in the ESLint configuration will trigger a runtime error during the linting process.
