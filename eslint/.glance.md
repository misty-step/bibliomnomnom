The `/eslint` directory serves as a dedicated internal library for custom ESLint plugins within the `bibliomnomnom` repository. Its primary purpose is to enforce project-specific architectural constraints and design system integrity through static analysis. The architecture adheres to the standard ESLint plugin pattern, exporting a rules object that utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) traversal to identify and report code quality issues.

### Key File Roles

**design-tokens.js**
This file implements the `no-raw-design-values` rule, acting as a gatekeeper for the project’s design system. It prevents the use of "magic numbers" and hard-coded styling values (colors and dimensions) by ensuring developers use approved design tokens.

- **Detection Logic**: The rule targets `Literal` and `TemplateElement` AST nodes. It employs specific regular expressions—`HEX_REGEX`, `RGB_REGEX`, and `PX_REGEX`—to identify raw hexadecimal colors, `rgb`/`rgba` functions, and pixel measurements.
- **Exclusion Logic**: The plugin incorporates automated path-based filtering, ignoring files within `node_modules`, `.next/` directories, and the design system's own token definitions (e.g., `tokens.generated`). It also exempts specific JSX attributes, such as `sizes` and `media`, where raw numerical values are syntactically necessary.
- **Configuration**: The rule is designed for flexibility via the ESLint `options` schema, allowing for custom `allow` patterns (string or RegEx) and a configurable `messageSuffix` to provide context-specific guidance to developers.

### Dependencies and Technical Constraints

- **ESLint Rule API**: The implementation is built upon the standard ESLint `rule.create` context. It relies heavily on `context.report` for flagging violations and `context.getFilename()` for implementing its path-based filtering logic.
- **AST Node Targeting**: By specifically targeting `Literal` and `TemplateElement` nodes, the plugin captures values in both standard string assignments and dynamic template literals.
- **RegEx Sensitivity**: Detection precision depends on a negative lookahead within the hexadecimal regex to avoid false positives.
- **Validation Gotchas**: The plugin includes a safety wrapper for custom exclusion patterns; if an invalid regular expression string is passed through the ESLint configuration, it will trigger a runtime error during the linting process.
