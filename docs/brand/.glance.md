The `/docs/brand` directory serves as the definitive technical and creative specification for the Bibliomnomnom brand identity. It establishes the visual and linguistic framework required to maintain consistency across the application’s UI, marketing materials, and communication channels. The documentation is structured to bridge the gap between high-level brand strategy and front-end implementation.

### Architecture and Key File Roles

The directory is organized into four primary Markdown files, each governing a specific pillar of the brand system:

- **`README.md`**: Acts as the central registry and entry point. It provides a high-level summary of the brand's visual identity and explicitly links the documentation to the codebase via design tokens.
- **`colors.md`**: Defines the functional color system. It categorizes colors into Canvas (backgrounds), Text, Surface (elevated elements), and Accents. It includes a specialized "Gold System" for premium features and provides the mapping for CSS custom properties and Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **`typography.md`**: Outlines the typographic hierarchy and font stacks. It specifies three distinct font families: **Playfair Display** (Serif) for headings, **Geist** (Sans) for body and UI, and **JetBrains Mono** (Monospace) for data like ISBNs. It also defines a standardized type scale and line-height constraints.
- **`voice.md`**: Establishes the verbal identity. It dictates a "reader-first" vocabulary (e.g., using "Library" instead of "Dashboard") and sets the tone spectrum for various application states, ensuring the copy remains warm, intellectual, and privacy-focused.

### Technical Implementation and Dependencies

The brand system is tightly integrated with the application's styling layer through the following mechanisms:

- **Design Tokens**: The values defined in these documents are implemented as design tokens in `/lib/design/tokens.generated.ts`. This file is the single source of truth for programmatic usage; developers are expected to consume these tokens rather than hardcoding hex values or font strings.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: The color and typography systems are designed to map directly to Tailwind classes (e.g., `bg-canvas-bone`, `font-display`), facilitating rapid UI development that adheres to brand standards.
- **External Assets**: The system depends on specific font assets: "Playfair Display", "Geist", and "JetBrains Mono". Proper rendering requires these families to be available via the global CSS environment or a font-loading utility.

### Critical Constraints and Gotchas

- **Color Prohibitions**: The system strictly forbids the use of pure white (`#FFFFFF`) for backgrounds and pure black (`#000000`) for text, favoring "Bone" and "Ink" respectively to reduce eye strain and maintain a "bookish" aesthetic.
- **Accessibility**: High contrast must be maintained between the "Ink" text and "Bone" backgrounds to ensure readability.
- **Vocabulary Constraints**: The voice guidelines mandate specific terminology; using industry-standard terms like "User" or "Content" is considered a violation of the brand's "Reader" and "Books" focus.
- **Usage Rules**: The "Gold" decorative system is reserved for premium indicators and badges; over-application is flagged as a misuse of the brand's "Quietly Confident" attribute.
